这个项目是基于https://github.com/kuczmmar/Running-ahead-of-memory-latency的修改版本。

增加了/gem5/configs/runahead/Rewrite.py，这个文件是/gem5/configs/runahead/o3_2level.py的复制衍生版本，主要增加了对“--MaxInsts”命令的识别以指定最大指令执行数。

修改了/gem5/run.sh 主要增加了对spec2006的一些benchmark的路径（这些bench不在本项目中，使用时请修改为你本地的bench路径），同时调整了gem5运行脚本，改变为ReWrite.py，增加对最大指令数的指定(这个参数可以在run.sh中修改)。

在目前的测试中，原作者实现的Pre cpu 存在潜在的问题。
# Runahead and Precise Runahead Execution implementation using system simulator [gem5](https://www.gem5.org/)
This is the repository used for my final year projectduring my Computer Science degree at the University of Cambridge. 
The project is fully described in my dissertation --- ''Running ahead of memory latency - processor runahead'', which can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/kuczmmar/Running-ahead-of-memory-latency).
My implementations are based on the papers that proposed [runahead](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183532) and [PRE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9065552).


## Installation
Following the online [gem5 tutorial](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/part1/building/), the recommended way tp install all dependencies on Ubuntu is to run the following command:
```sh
sudo apt install build-essential git m4 scons zlib1g zlib1g-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libprotoc-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev python-dev python
```

Clone the repository.

## Development
The best place to start learning gem5 is [the online tutorial](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction/).

To run my simulation setup enter the gem5  and in script run.sh ammend line number 15, this is responsible for compiling gem5. 
On a computer with 8 cores the recommended way to compile is:
```sh
python3 `which scons` build/X86/gem5.opt -j9
```
Alternatively, one can specify the exact path to scons directory. Given more cores, you can increase the parallelisation parameter e.g. on a 32 core machine:
```sh
python3 ./bin/scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j33
```

To compile gem5 and run the test script simply use:
```sh
./gem5/run.sh -c
```
To only run the tests:
```sh
./gem5/run.sh
```
